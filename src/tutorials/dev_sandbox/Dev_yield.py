    Yield creates a generator, meaning:
    
        - You need to iterate through what the yield sent to get the next data
        - You do not need to wait for the return of the processing of a huge list
        - You can do unknown or infinite loops
        _ You can have special condition to make it stop defined
        - Pratice will yield its fruits
